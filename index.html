            <p>A note I wrote sitting in the Tel Aviv airport:</p>

            <p>Over the past decade or so, I've struggled to make sense of my feelings towards Israel. As an American with no family here, it has often felt silly to care so much about this faraway place. And maybe it is. But as a Jew, I feel inherently intertwined in what's happening here. Not only because this country has forever changed our history and future as Jews but, more fundamentally, because I do - or at least did - believe in the promise of this national project.</p>

            <p>Irreconcilable is the word I have often used to describe my feelings towards Israel. When I arrived here for the first time, it filled me with complete awe to be served coffee by a Jewish barista in a Jewish state, to greet a bellman in the language of the Torah, and to walk Tel Aviv's trendy streets bearing the names of iconic Jewish poets and artists. Witnessing the distinctly cool life here completely changed my understanding of what it could mean to be Jewish. Which is to say, it completely changed my understanding of what it could mean to be myself. For the first time, I began to explore this core aspect of my identity rather than doing anything I could to hide it. For the first time, I felt a sense of pride to be Jewish - to be myself - rather than shame.</p>

            <p>This was my fourth time here and I am still overcome with awe. Just like each time before, I spent hours daydreaming about the fascination – and the utter disbelief – my grandparents and ancestors would have felt if they could have just been here with me to see this place. Would they believe that a thriving Jewish country had risen from the ashes of the concentration camps? Would they find in Jerusalem the freedom they spent each Passover praying for? Like each time before, it brought me to literal tears to feel that I could be a tiny part of the revival of a people – my people – that they had only dreamed of witnessing. I don't really know how to describe how powerful that feeling is.</p>

            <p>And yet, with time, my relationship with this place has become complicated and the moments of self-discovery and awe – as if scripted by the Birthright donors who first brought me here – shrouded in painful realities. I often wondered over the past two weeks, how does this place exist? The answers I told myself before – of the dreams of Zionist ideologues for a Jewish renewal in the Holy land – have mostly been replaced by a more candid acknowledgment: ethnic cleansing and eternal occupation. And my fascination with the cities where Jewish culture, art, and futures are being rewritten in coffeeshops and libraries every day has been muddled by the brutal military occupation upheld by their same residents just a few miles away.</p>

            <p>When I arrived in the West Bank for the first time, I was equally awestruck. But this time, shock and sadness filled my veins rather than amazement and pride. It was shocking to witness children with schoolbags full of textbooks be funneled through crowded checkpoint turnstiles by a remote voice shouting demands in broken Arabic – move quickly, come forward, wait there. And it was even more shocking when my gaze from the window of our shuttle, passing slowly through a checkpoint en route to Nablus, directly aligned with the muzzle of an Israeli soldier's rifle pointed at the passing cars from a watchtower above – ready to fire at any moment.</p>

            <p>Life continued as usual in that shuttle - my seatmate's eyes glued to TikTok videos as we passed in front of the armed soldiers of a foreign military – but the moment has stuck with me. How could a people who have been victims to the very worst of humanity come to treat their neighbors this way? If my grandparents could have just been with me during this moment too – would they view our freedom as being worth all of this?</p>

            <p>After a few days in Nablus, I traveled back to Tel Aviv, dropped off my stuff at the hotel, and walked to a protest. Amid a sea of thousands of waving Israeli flags, the protestors screamed Bushah (shame) after the speakers listed each of what they viewed as the ills of Israeli society - the judicial reform, the political power of the Haredim, the far-right government's attacks on secular life. There was no mention of their children pointing loaded rifles at traveling families less than 50 miles away. There was no mention of the sea of settlements that have transformed the Palestinian map into a patchwork of disconnected villages and towns. There was no mention of the innocent Palestinian boy killed in the town next to the checkpoint while I crossed into Palestine two days before. For those, there is no shame.</p>

            <p>I came to Israel/Palestine to participate in an anti-occupation tour with young Jews and to do some personal travel. Two weeks here is basically nothing, but I return to the US with renewed clarity of the crimes being committed here in my name and of my community's role in supporting a historic injustice. After 56 years of occupation, the Israeli flag that stands next to the bema where I had my bar mitzvah and where I have prayed each year since I was a child, can no longer only represent the thriving Jewish state that I came to admire. Today, it also represents apartheid, Jewish supremacy, and a colonial project hell-bent on denying Palestinian freedom.</p>

            <p>It's heartbreaking to come to term with all of this because I do feel deeply attached to the Jewish people and I do, still, love Israel. But there can be no success - or democracy, for that matter - when half of the people on this land live at the whims of a foreign power they have no way of influencing. "Start up nation", the bustling and diverse cities, the thriving cultural scene - none of it can matter as long as the occupation remains.</p>

            <p>There is tremendous beauty and meaning in this place but there is severe injustice too. I'm not sure I'm any closer to reconciling these two than I was before I left DC but I do think it's important to reckon with the situation as it is and not as we may wish it were. Fuck.</p>
